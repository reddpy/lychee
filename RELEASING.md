# Releasing Lychee

Lychee ships signed builds for macOS, Windows, and Linux, and delivers updates
in-app via [update.electronjs.org](https://update.electronjs.org) (mac/win) and
a notify-only banner (Linux). This doc is the end-to-end release procedure.

## TL;DR

```bash
pnpm version prerelease   # 0.1.0-alpha.1 → 0.1.0-alpha.2 (bumps package.json, commits, tags)
git push --follow-tags    # pushes the commit + tag; the v* tag triggers the release workflows
```

That's it. The three release workflows build, sign, and publish a GitHub
Release with all platform assets. Within ~15 minutes, installed apps on the
previous version see the update.

## The one rule: `package.json` version is the single source of truth

The number in `package.json` `"version"` is the **only** place the app version
is defined. Everything else derives from it:

- `app.getVersion()` reads it → shown in **Settings → About**.
- The git **tag** must match it (`pnpm version` guarantees this).
- `update.electronjs.org` compares the running app's version (from
  `package.json`) against the latest GitHub **release tag** to decide whether to
  offer an update (mac/win).
- The Linux poll (`src/main/updater.ts`) compares `app.getVersion()` against
  release tags via `semver`.

If the tag and `package.json` disagree, auto-update misbehaves (the app either
never sees the update or misreports its version). **Always bump with
`pnpm version`** rather than hand-editing — it keeps the commit, the tag, and
`package.json` locked together.

## Choosing the bump

`pnpm version <type>` (same semantics as `npm version`):

| Command | `0.1.0-alpha.1` becomes | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm version prerelease` | `0.1.0-alpha.2` | iterating during alpha (default for now) |
| `pnpm version prepatch`   | `0.1.1-alpha.0` | starting a new prerelease line off a patch |
| `pnpm version patch`      | `0.1.0`         | cutting the first stable from an alpha |
| `pnpm version minor`      | `0.2.0`         | backwards-compatible features |
| `pnpm version major`      | `1.0.0`         | breaking changes |

The created tag is prefixed with `v` (e.g. `v0.1.0-alpha.2`); `package.json`
itself stays unprefixed (`0.1.0-alpha.2`). Both the updater and
update.electronjs.org tolerate the `v` prefix.

> **Prereleases and update.electronjs.org:** the hosted service serves the
> latest GitHub release. If you mark releases as *prerelease* in GitHub, the
> mac/win auto-updater may not pick them up (it prefers stable releases). The
> Linux poll *does* include prereleases. For an alpha you want everyone updating
> on, publish releases as normal (not flagged prerelease), or revisit this once
> you cut stable.

## What happens on a `v*` tag push

Three workflows run in parallel (each also supports manual `workflow_dispatch`):

| Workflow | Runner | Produces | Signing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/release-macos.yml` | macOS | `.dmg`, `.zip` | Developer ID + notarization |
| `.github/workflows/release-windows.yml` | Windows | `Setup.exe`, `.nupkg`, `RELEASES` | Azure Trusted Signing |
| `.github/workflows/release-linux.yml` | Ubuntu | `.deb`, `.rpm` | none (notify-only) |

Each builds with `pnpm make`, verifies signatures, then publishes to a single
GitHub Release for the tag. The first workflow to finish runs
`gh release create`; the others fall back to `gh release upload --clobber`, so
they all attach to the same release regardless of finish order.

### Why these specific assets matter

The auto-updater is picky about what it consumes:

- **macOS** (Squirrel.Mac via update.electronjs.org) needs the **`.zip`** of the
  app. The `.dmg` is for first-time human downloads.
- **Windows** (Squirrel.Windows) needs **`RELEASES` + `.nupkg` + `Setup.exe`**
  together. Missing any one breaks the update feed.
- **Linux** has no auto-update; the app's About pane just links users to the
  releases page to download the **`.deb`/`.rpm`** manually.

## Required GitHub secrets

These must be configured in the repo (Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions) for signing to succeed:

**macOS** — `MACOS_CERT_P12_BASE64`, `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`,
`APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.

**Windows** (Azure Trusted Signing) — `AZURE_CODE_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`,
`AZURE_CERT_PROFILE`, `AZURE_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`,
`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

**Linux** — none.

## Verifying a release

1. The GitHub Release for the tag exists and carries: `*.dmg`, `*.zip` (mac),
   `*Setup.exe`, `*.nupkg`, `RELEASES` (win), `*.deb`, `*.rpm` (linux).
2. The release is **not** flagged as a draft (the updater ignores drafts).
3. On a machine running the previous version, leave the app open ~15 min:
   - **mac/win** download in the background; **Settings → About** then shows
     “… is ready to install” with **Restart & Update**.
   - **Linux** shows “… is available” with a **Download** button linking to the
     releases page.

### Checking the update feed directly (no install needed)

You can confirm update.electronjs.org sees a release without installing anything.
**The path is `platform-arch`, not just `platform`** — the app requests
`darwin-arm64`, so checking plain `/darwin/` will mislead you (it looks for an
Intel build we don't ship and 404s even when the arm64 zip is present):

```bash
# Ask "is there something newer than <version>?"
curl -s https://update.electronjs.org/reddpy/lychee/darwin-arm64/<version>   # Apple Silicon
curl -s https://update.electronjs.org/reddpy/lychee/win32/<version>/RELEASES # Windows
#   200 + JSON/RELEASES body → update available
#   204 No Content           → already on the latest
#   404                       → wrong path/arch, missing zip, or release flagged prerelease/draft
```

The mac zip must match `.*-(mac|darwin|osx).*\.zip` — our Forge output
(`Lychee-darwin-arm64-<version>.zip`) satisfies this. update.electronjs.org caches
for a few minutes, so give a freshly-published release a moment before checking.

## Local build sanity check (no publish)

```bash
pnpm make          # builds installers for the current OS into out/make/
```

Signing only activates when the relevant env vars are present, so local `make`
produces unsigned artifacts — fine for smoke-testing packaging, not for release.

## Notes

- The updater is intentionally **inert** in dev (`pnpm start`) and E2E builds —
  About shows “Updates are delivered automatically in installed builds.” You can
  only exercise the real update flow from a signed, installed build.
- After packaging locally (`pnpm make` / `E2E=1 pnpm run package`),
  `better-sqlite3` is rebuilt against Electron's ABI; run `pnpm test` (its
  `pretest` rebuilds for Node) before trusting backend test results.
